This project is something I started to learn more about messaging protocols that run on top of TCP sockets. I came across the need for something like this to aid in the development of my other project, “IM Secure Chat” (https://github.com/Schlitzkrieg/IMSecureChat-Server).

I am aware that other means of sending and receiving acks for data exists, so consider this project to be more along the lines of self-edification. I usually am against reinventing the wheel.
